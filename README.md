Scatterbrained makes it easy to build federated learning systems. In addition to traditional federated learning, Scatterbrained supports decentralized federated learning â€” a new, cooperative type of federated learning where the learning is done by a group of peers instead of by a centralized server. For more information, see our 2021 paper, [_Scatterbrained: A flexible and expandable pattern for decentralized machine learning_](#).

You can use your favorite machine learning frameworks alongside Scatterbrained, such as TensorFlow, SciKit-Learn, or PyTorch.

## Usage

For examples of how to get started using Scatterbrained, see the [Examples](examples/) directory.

## Installation

You can install Scatterbrained with pip:

```shell
pip install scatterbrained
```

If you would rather download and install from source, you can do so with the following:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JHUAPL/scatterbrained.git
cd scatterbrained
```

You must first install the dependencies with:

```shell
pip3 install -r ./requirements/requirements.txt
```

And then you can install the package with:

```shell
pip3 install -e .
```
